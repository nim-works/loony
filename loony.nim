  TagPtr is an alias for 8 byte uint (pointer). We reserve a portion of
  the tail to contain the index of the slot to its corresponding node
  by aligning the node pointers on allocation. Since the index value is
  stored in the same memory word as its associated node pointer, the FAA
  operations could potentially affect both values if too many increments
  were to occur. This is accounted for in the algorithm and with space
  for overflow in the alignment. See Section 5.2 for the paper to see
  why an overflow would prove impossible except under extraordinarily
  large number of thread contention.

#[
  Fundamentally, both enqueue and dequeue operations attempt to
  exclusively reserve access to a slot in the array of their associated
  queue node by automatically incremementing the appropriate index value
  and retrieving the previous value of the index as well as the current
  node pointer.

  Threads that retrieve an index i < loonySlotCount (length of the slots array) gain
  *exclusive* rights to perform either write/consume operation on the
  corresponding slot.

  This guarantees there can only be exactly one of each for any given
  slot.

  Where i < loonySlotCount, we use FAST PATH operations. These operations are
  designed to be as fast as possible while only dealing with memory
  contention in rare edge cases.

  if not i < loonySlotCount, we enter SLOW PATH operations. See AdvTail and AdvHead
  above.

  Fetch And Add (FAA) primitives are used for both incrementing index
  values as well as performing read(consume) and write operations on
  reserved slots which drastically improves scalability compared to
  Compare And Swap (CAS) primitives.

  Note that all operations on slots must modify the slots state bits to
  announce both operations completion (in case of a read) and also makes
  determining the order in which two operations occured possible.

  Consumed slots have been written to and then read. If a concurrent
  deque operation outpaces the corresponding enqueue operation then both
  operations have to abandon and try again. Once all slots in the node
  have been consumed or abandoned, the node is considered drained and
  unlinked from the list. Node can be reclaimed and de-allocated.

  Queue manages an enqueue index and a dequeue index. Each are modified
  by fetchAndAdd; gives thread reserves previous index for itself which
  may be used to address a slot in the respective nodes array.

  both node pointers are tagged with their assoc index value ->
  they store both address to respective node as well as the current
  index value in the same memory word.

  Requires a sufficient number of available bits that are not used to
  present the nodes addresses themselves.
